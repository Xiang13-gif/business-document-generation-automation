# Business Document Generation Automation

A senior-level Banking Business Analyst / Product Owner portfolio case for evidence-grounded commercial credit document generation, decision governance, data lineage, value realization, and delivery assurance.

Live site: [https://xiang13-gif.github.io/business-document-generation-automation/](https://xiang13-gif.github.io/business-document-generation-automation/)

This project shows how a commercial lending team can move from fragmented documents and manual control interpretation to an evidence-led transformation platform connecting credit memo generation, checklist rules, approval authority, policy exceptions, critical data, UAT, release decisions, and measurable business value.

## Portfolio Positioning

This is not a generic dashboard or AI writing demo. It is a GitHub-ready banking transformation case showing how a BA can frame the problem, design controlled decisions, govern data and rules, assure delivery, and evaluate whether the product creates value.

Target review audience:

- Banking Business Analyst hiring managers
- Product Analyst and Product Owner teams
- Credit Operations and Lending Services teams
- Risk, Controls, and Transformation teams
- Recruiters screening for financial services domain capability

## Case Study Summary

| Area | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Business problem | Commercial credit teams lose time and control when documents, rule changes, source data, approval decisions, UAT evidence, and release readiness are managed across disconnected tools. |
| Proposed solution | An evidence-led credit transformation platform covering document intelligence, rule and exception governance, critical data lineage, delivery assurance, and benefits realization. |
| Primary workflow | Case evidence drives checklist and memo generation; governed rules determine control outputs; data and UAT evidence feed approval and release gates; outcome metrics support roadmap decisions. |
| BA value shown | Strategy analysis, requirements, rule ownership, data lineage, change impact, UAT, cutover, risk controls, solution evaluation, financial viability, and executive recommendation. |
| Data boundary | Mock data only. No confidential bank, customer, policy, employee, or production system information. |

## Business Problem

Commercial credit applications often involve multiple facilities, collateral items, guarantors, financial statements, policy exceptions, approval authorities, and operational handoffs.

Common pain points modeled in this project:

- RM submissions with missing mandatory documents
- Manual interpretation of product and collateral document requirements
- Waiver decisions captured without enough structure or audit evidence
- Approval routing uncertainty caused by exposure, risk, collateral, and exception complexity
- Policy exceptions hidden in notes instead of a controlled register
- UAT defects and retests disconnected from the requirements they validate
- Management visibility dependent on offline trackers
- Credit memo drafting disconnected from source evidence and missing-data controls
- Rule changes activated without consistent version, impact, or regression evidence
- Critical credit data lacking clear source-to-decision lineage and ownership
- Go-live and benefit decisions based on status reporting rather than measurable evidence

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Evidence-grounded Credit Memo generation with source lineage and human approval
- Responsible AI controls for confidence, unsupported evidence, masking, versioning, and fallback
- Business rule registry, version comparison, maker-checker, impact analysis, and regression testing
- Critical data element inventory, data quality controls, lineage, ownership, and issue impact
- Adjustable benefits case, outcome scorecard, financial viability, and product roadmap
- Go / No-Go readiness gates, cutover sequencing, rollback triggers, and hypercare indicators
- Rule-based document checklist generation
- Mandatory, conditional, and optional document classification
- Document status tracking and submission readiness gate
- Waiver approval workflow with maker-checker control
- Document package summary with BA recommendation
- SLA aging indicators for documentation follow-up
- Waiver and missing-document control thinking
- Risk-based delegated authority routing
- Policy exception capture and governance
- Case lifecycle visibility through a Credit Case 360 view
- UAT planning, defect tracking, retest status, and release readiness
- Requirement-to-rule-to-test-to-change-request traceability
- Executive dashboard storytelling for credit operations
- Frontend implementation with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts

## Core Modules

## Suggested Demo Flow

1. Open `/memo`, select `CASE-1007`, and show how unsupported EDD, exception, and route evidence block approval.
2. Switch to `CASE-1006`, mark evidence-ready sections Reviewed, approve the memo, compare versions, and export the evidence map.
3. Open `/rules`, run `RT-005`, and show how the proposed Land Search Report requirement produces a controlled design gap and blocks activation.
4. Select a passing regression scenario and explain the requirement-to-rule-to-UAT activation gate.
5. Open `/data-governance`, select `CDE-005`, and trace Collateral Value from source through transformation and rules into approval and memo outputs.
6. Open `/value`, adjust annual volume, effort, cost, and implementation assumptions to show how payback and the investment recommendation change.
7. Open `/release`, resolve or introduce gates and show how the recommendation changes between No-Go, Conditional Go, and Go.
8. Review the cutover rollback triggers and hypercare thresholds.
9. Open `/checklist` and demonstrate document readiness, waiver maker-checker, SLA aging, and package summary.
10. Open `/approval-routing` and show how exposure, risk, collateral, and exception severity change delegated authority.
11. Open `/case-360` to connect case lifecycle, exceptions, UAT evidence, and next actions.
12. Open `/traceability` to show requirement-to-rule-to-test-to-change-request coverage.
