## README First-Screen Goals

The top of the README should answer five questions quickly:

| Question | Answer to show |
| --- | --- |
| What is it? | A business document generation automation case study for commercial credit applications. |
| Who is it for? | Banking BA, Product Analyst, Credit Operations, Risk, Controls, and Transformation reviewers. |
| What problem does it solve? | Fragmented document evidence, uncontrolled rule changes, weak data lineage, unclear release posture, and unmeasured product value. |
| What did the BA design? | Credit memo controls, requirements, rule lifecycle, data lineage, approval logic, UAT, cutover, value scorecard, traceability, and audit evidence. |
| Is it safe to publish? | Yes. It uses mock data only and no confidential bank information. |

## Suggested Screenshots

Add screenshots under `public/screenshots/` if available:

| Screenshot | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `checklist-generator.png` | Shows the core document automation workflow. |
| `credit-memo-studio.png` | Shows actual document generation with source lineage, confidence, missing evidence, review, and approval. |
| `rule-governance.png` | Shows version comparison, impact analysis, regression Test Lab, and activation gate. |
| `data-lineage.png` | Shows critical data flowing from source through rules into credit decisions. |
| `value-realization.png` | Shows adjustable financial viability and outcome-led roadmap decisions. |
| `release-readiness.png` | Shows No-Go gates, cutover rollback criteria, and hypercare ownership. |
| `case-360.png` | Shows document readiness connected to lifecycle, risk, UAT, and next actions. |
| `approval-routing.png` | Shows delegated authority and rule rationale. |
| `dashboard.png` | Shows executive reporting and portfolio metrics. |
| `traceability.png` | Shows BA artifact linkage from requirement to test and CR. |

## Demo Flow for Reviewers

1. Start with `/memo` and use CASE-1007 to show unsupported evidence blocking approval.
2. Switch to CASE-1006, review and approve the complete memo, compare versions, and export evidence lineage.
3. Open `/rules`, run RT-005, and show the proposed property document gap blocking activation.
4. Open `/data-governance`, select CDE-005, and explain how stale valuation data affects approval and memo outputs.
5. Open `/value`, change assumptions, and show the investment recommendation react to payback and benefit.
6. Open `/release`, resolve or introduce readiness gates, and show No-Go / Conditional Go / Go posture.
7. Review cutover rollback triggers and hypercare thresholds.
8. Open `/checklist` to demonstrate waiver maker-checker, SLA aging, and package readiness.
9. Open `/case-360` to connect lifecycle, risk, UAT, and next actions.
10. Open `/traceability` to show requirement-to-rule-to-test-to-change-request coverage.

## LinkedIn Project Description

```text
Built a commercial credit transformation portfolio platform demonstrating how a Banking Business Analyst / Product Owner can connect evidence-grounded document generation, rule governance, critical data lineage, approval controls, UAT, release assurance, and measurable product value.
```

Suggested bullets:

- Designed evidence-grounded Credit Memo generation with source lineage, confidence, missing-evidence blockers, human review, versioning, masking, and independent approval.
- Established business-rule version governance, impact analysis, regression scenarios, maker-checker, and activation controls.
- Modeled critical data lineage and DQ issue impact from source system through decision rules into documents and reporting.
- Built measurable benefits, financial viability, outcome-led roadmap, Go / No-Go gates, cutover rollback, and hypercare governance.
- Preserved traceability across requirements, rules, UAT, defects, change requests, audit evidence, and BA recommendations.
