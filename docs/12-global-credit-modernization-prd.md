# Business Document Generation Automation PRD

## Product Name

Business Document Generation Automation

## Product Objective

Create a GitHub-ready Banking Business Analyst / Product Analyst portfolio app that demonstrates rule-based commercial credit document checklist generation, waiver controls, case lifecycle visibility, approval routing, policy exception governance, UAT tracking, change impact analysis, traceability, audit evidence, and executive dashboard storytelling.

## Target Audience

- Recruiters
- Hiring managers
- Banking BA leads
- Product owners
- Credit operations leaders
- Risk and control reviewers
- Interviewers reviewing financial services project capability

## Problem Statement

Commercial lending workflows are difficult to demonstrate in a public portfolio because real bank artifacts are confidential. This project provides a safe, anonymized simulation of how a BA would modernize a credit workflow while preserving risk, control, and audit thinking.

## Scope

In scope:

- Executive Dashboard
- Credit Case 360
- Approval Routing Simulator
- Policy Exception Register
- Document Checklist Generator
- UAT Test Case Tracker
- UAT defect and retest workflow
- Change Request Impact Analyzer
- Role-Based Workflow View
- Traceability Matrix
- Audit Trail
- Project Case Study page
- Mock data
- Local browser state for UAT status, retest status, and activity events

Out of scope:

- Real customer data
- Real bank policy
- Authentication
- Database persistence
- Production workflow approval
- Core banking integration
- Credit scoring model
- Regulatory reporting submission

## Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| REQ001 | Generate checklist based on application type. |
| REQ002 | Require waiver if financial statement is missing. |
| REQ003 | Require revised approval memo for enhancement application. |
| REQ004 | Require EDD for high risk customer. |
| REQ005 | Generate collateral documents based on collateral type. |
| REQ006 | Generate trade facility documents for Trade Line. |
| REQ007 | Generate BG Application Form and Counter Indemnity for Bank Guarantee. |
| REQ008 | Track UAT test case status and delivery metrics. |
| REQ009 | Show change request impact across requirements, UAT, controls, and roles. |
| REQ010 | Show portfolio analytics for checklist, UAT, CR, and traceability coverage. |
| REQ011 | Track defect severity, root cause, and retest status for failed UAT cases. |
| REQ012 | Show role-based responsibilities, controls, open UAT cases, and impacted CRs. |
| REQ013 | Record local audit events for key BA workflow actions. |
| REQ017 | Recommend approval route based on exposure, risk, collateral, segment, application type, facility type, and exception severity. |
| REQ018 | Require reason, authorized role, and audit evidence when approval route is overridden. |
| REQ019 | Track policy exceptions by severity, owner, mitigation, aging, approval tier, evidence, requirement linkage, and UAT coverage. |
| REQ020 | Show pipeline aging, bottlenecks, owner role, exception volume, and document readiness in the dashboard. |
| REQ021 | Show end-to-end case lifecycle evidence across profile, documents, analysis, route, exceptions, UAT, audit, and next actions. |
| REQ022 | Calculate release posture from readiness gates so blocked evidence prevents a case from appearing ready. |
