## Change Request Assessment Template

| Assessment Area | Questions |
| --- | --- |
| Business value | What problem does the request solve? Is it required for go-live or a later enhancement? |
| Control impact | Does it affect approval authority, waiver, audit trail, or segregation of duties? |
| Data impact | Are new fields, validations, or reporting dimensions required? |
| Process impact | Which roles and handoffs change? |
| Testing impact | Which UAT scenarios must be added or amended? |
| Delivery impact | Does it affect timeline, dependencies, or release scope? |

## Example CR Detail: CR-002

### Request

Allow RM to submit a case when the latest audited financial statements are not yet available, provided that an approved waiver is captured.

### Business Reason

Some renewal cases may require processing before final audited financial statements are available. The business needs a controlled way to proceed using interim management accounts and other supporting documents.

### BA Assessment

The request is reasonable, but it should not create a bypass. The system should require:

- Document waiver reason
- Supporting interim documents
- Exception category = Documentation
- Exception severity based on business rule
- Approval by authorized role
- Audit trail entry

### Requirement Impact

Affected artifacts:

- FR-005 Document status
- FR-008 Exception capture
- NFR-002 Maker-checker control
- UAT-008 Capture exception
- UAT-012 Prevent maker from approving own waiver

### Decision

Approved with control requirements.
